Robots are smart… by design !!
Who make those Robots smart? Its Machine Learning! In this project, the task is to help robots recognize the floor surface they’re standing on using data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors) placed on the robots.
Multilayer Layer Perceptrons(MLP) used in the Deep Learning model help to capture relations between sensor data and thus predict the nature of surface the bot is standing on .
